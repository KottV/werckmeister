Werckmeister Manual
===================

Vision
------
Consider the beauty of lead sheet music: you write a melody and some chords. Thats it.
<br>Later you can tell your band in which style the piece has to be played. You can say, after 4 beats play it as a bossa nova or a blues or whatever.

This is the idea behind Werckmeister. Of course it can not replace a band or a musician but it offers you a tool to write melodies and chords then you can define how to interpret the chords along your melody or even define your own interpretation templates.

Why text only and no GUI
------------------------
The motivation behind this decision cames with an experience which I had in the past with a professional scorewriter software I was using back in the early 2000.

This software was a bit clunky but I've got used to it. At some point the developer discontinued the support for my version and I've got more and more problems to get the software running on a modern system. The other problem was, that my project files were written in a proprietary format. 

So I realized: 
<br>**not I am the owner of my written music, the company behind the scorewriter software owns it
 and if I want to continue using my projects I have to pay money.**

So I've came to the conclusion, that readable text files is my way to go.

*What is so hard writing notes in a text edior such as `c d e f g` in comparison to an overloaded clunky editor software.
<br>(actually notes in a score have a lot advantages in comparison to a text file regarding readability etc., but that aside)*

I've discovered that [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) is a good way to write music using textfiles.
But for me there was a problem: LilyPond's main purpose is make score visible. So the LilyPond language is designed to describe how notes have to look on paper in the first place. Basically, I wanted the same but with the focus on how the notes sounds played by MIDI instruments.




## What it wants to be
* a fast and easy way to create lead sheet music
* that tool in your toolchain, between the initial idea of an piece and developing the details in your favourite Sequencer/DAW
* a way to create music without a Graphical User Interface
* a tool which relies only on human readable files


## What it doesn't want to be
* a replacement to your favourite Sequencer/DAW
* a scorewriter software
* a programming language

## Don't be afraid, it's just text
The Werckmeister language knows only a few statement types. It's all about tracks, voices, and events. That's it. 
<br>The remaining statements are just for configuration purposes.

A basic Werckmeister document will look like this:

```
-- CONFIG STUFF:
-- 1) configure your MIDI device
-- 2) define an instrument with the name piano
-- 3) set the tempo

-- 1)
--      name         type portnumber
device: MyMidiDevice midi 1;

-- 2)
--             name  device       ch pc cc
instrumentDef: piano MyMidiDevice 1  0  0;
-- (ch= channel, pc= programm change, cc= control change)

-- 3)
tempo: 130;

-- TRACKS, VOICES & EVENTS
-- now the actual musical statement, which is a track containing one voice with some note events
-- (the track is set up to use our piano instrument from above)
[
instrument: piano;
{
    c4 d e f | g1 --note events
}
]
```
#### Tracks and Voices

A track in Werckmeister has excactly the same meanig as it has in a MIDI file.
It is related to an instrument and contains events.

A track begins with a `[` and ends with a `]`.
```
-- a track with one voice and an instrument setup

[
instrument: piano;
{
    c d e f | g a b c'
}
]
```

All events of a track are releated at least to one voice. A voice starts with `{` and ends with `}`.
If you want to write polyphonic melody lines, you can add more voices to your track. 



![a polyphonic melody](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SambaGodschynski/werckmeister/master/assets/poly.png)

The melody above would be written like this:

```
-- a track with two voices

[
instrument: piano;
{
    g4  f#8 g  a4   g
}
{
    d4   d     d    d
}
]

```

#### Events
There are a few event types:

**Note Events**
<br>have a pitch and a duration, to be performed by a MIDI instrument.
```
c d e f g
```

**Degree Events**
<br>have a relative pitch degree and a duration. In combination with a chord, degree events can be transformed into regular note events.
```
I II III IV V VI VII
```

**Chord Events**
<br>Events which are related to a name. They also store the information which interval is used for a degree. These informations are stored in a [chord definiton file](#chords).
```
C7 D-7 E-7 F7 Gmaj7 A-7
```


**Meta Events**
<br>Events to set up something or loading a mod script.
<br>You can recognize meta events by its slashes at the beginning and the end.
```
/tempo: 100/ -- meta event: set tempo to 100
c d e f
/tempo: 50/
a b c' 

```

{
    /tempo: double/
    c d e f | g a b c'
}

    /signature: 3 4/
    /tempo: 96/
    c e f | g b c'
}
{
    c d e f | g a b c'
}
]

```

#### Time Signatures
The time signature 4/4 by default.
If you want to setup a different time signature than the default, you can achieve this by using the signature [meta event](#Meta-Events).
With this you are able to setup different time signatures during a piece.
```
[
{
    /signature: 3 4/
    c e e | c e e |
    /signature: 4 4/
    c d e f | g a b c'
}
]
```

#### Key Signatures
key signatures are not supported.

## Write Melodies
#### Notes
The syntax is loosely inspired by the [lilypond](http://lilypond.org) notation syntax. A note is just a letter followed by a number for its duration.

*If a note has no duration, the last given duration will be used.*

```
c4 d e8 f
```

<br>*c and d will be played as quarter notes, e and f as eighth notes*

the end of a bar is marked by a pipe: `|`

```
c d e f | g a b c'
```


#### Octaves

Lower octaves are marked by a comma (`,`) after the note, upper octaves by a single quote (`'`).

```
c,,  e,,  g,, | c, e, g, | c e g | c' e' g' | c'' e'' g''
```

#### Accidentals

`#` raises a pitch by a half step.
<br> A `b` lowers it. 

```
c# d# f# g# | bb db' eb' gb'
```

#### Durations

A numeric value after a note marks its duration.

```
c2 c4 c8 c16 c32 c64 c128 r
```

#### Intervals and Chords

Notes that have to sound simultaneous are written in angle brackets. The duration is written after the brackets.

![two chords](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SambaGodschynski/werckmeister/master/assets/chords.png)

```
<g,, c e g bb>4   <c, c eb g bb>2.
```

#### Augmentation Dots & Ties

To write a augmentation dot (`.`) append a dot to a note duration value.
<br>For ties use a tilde (`~`) instead. 

![dots and ties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SambaGodschynski/werckmeister/master/assets/dotsties.png)


```
c2. c4 | c2~ c4 c
```

#### Tuplets

To write tuplets of any kind you just have to write parentheses and a duration value. For example: `(c c c)4`.
These three notes will now be played on time for one quarter.
You don't have to mind how many notes with what duration you write.
All notes in that parentheses fit their value.

So it doesn't matter if you write `(c2 c2 c2)4` or `(c8 c8 c8)4` because you have three notes with equal durations to be played in the time of one quarter.

*The relations between the notes are vital, not the absolute durations.*

![n-tole examples with 3,7 and 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SambaGodschynski/werckmeister/master/assets/tuplets.png)

```
(c8 c c)4   (c8 c c c c)4  (c8 c c c c c c)4  (c8 c c c c c c c c)4
```

##### Nested Tuplets

You are also able to write nested tuplets:

![a example of nested tuplets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SambaGodschynski/werckmeister/master/assets/blackpages.png)

```
b2 ((b c#' c#' b d')  (f' a a bb c')  (e' a' bb' f' c' g))2
```

## Accomp My Melodies

Imagine you give your bass player some chords, and he or she asks you to play these.
<br>You would say something like: play the 1st degree on one and the 5th degree on four. 

And this is exactly what you doing when writing style templates.
<br>So in our example above you would write:

```
-- make sure that you have a chord definition loaded
using "chords/default.chords";

device: MyDevice  midi 0;
--             name  device       ch pc cc
instrumentDef:bass  MyDevice      0  0  0;

-- here is the template:
[
type: template;
name: simpleBass;
instrument: bass;
{
    I,,2. V,,4 |
}
]

-- here are some chords:
[
type: accomp;
{
    /template: simpleBass/
    C | F | G | C |
}
]

```

Instead of writing absolute notes, you use relative degrees. For example `I4` means the first degree as a quarter note. 

*If a degree does not appear in a chord, the degree will not played.*

There are the same rules as for writing absolute [notes](#Notes):

such as:

* use `#` or `b` for sharp or flat
* to perform inervals use angle brackes. For example a triad: `<I II III>`
* use `~` for tied and `.` for dotted notes
* create tuplets using parantheses

To spice up our example a bit, we add a second bar which plays an interval with I and III

```
-- make sure that you have a chord definition loaded
using "chords/default.chords";

device: MyDevice  midi 0;
--             name  device       ch pc cc
instrumentDef:bass  MyDevice      0  0  0;

[
type: template;
name: simpleBass;
instrument: bass;
{
    I,,2. V,,4 | <I,, III,>1
}
]

[
type: accomp;
{
    /template: simpleBass/
    C | F | G | C |
}
]
```
